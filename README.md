# CSS3-3D-Animation
This was built for a Zales ad campaign running on iPad mobile web. Using only CSS3 3D transforms, I recreated the Zales jewelry box that could be opened upon user interaction. The only Javascript used is to add a click to the box and to apply a few classes to various elements on interaction. Look in the "iamges" folder to see the box deconstructed as flat images.

## Instructions
Click on the box to initiate the animation. If you click on the box again, it will close and you can restart the animation.

## Special Notes
This was originally built for iPads only so -webkit is the the primary prefix used. Please view this demo in Safari or Chrome.
